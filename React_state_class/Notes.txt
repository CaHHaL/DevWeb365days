In React components are nothing but JS functions

Writing markup JSX rules
=>Always return a single element.
=>Close all the tags(We use tags in the form of close in the JSX eg. <Title />).
=>camelCase is prepared in most of the thing.

Note :- *We cannot use the similar reserved keyword of JS and HTML with the same notation (eg:- class atrribute of html is used as className)*

React Fregment 
=>Basically help us to terminate the use of extra nodes.
=>It replaces the root node by <>...</> show that  no extra node is create in the DOM.
React Props 
=>This are the information pass to a JSX tags
React State
=>Used to re-render the components 
Hooks
=>Avaliable with fucntional components added in React 16.8
=>Help us to write state without writting a class
=> eg. useState()
useState()
=>It is React Hook that lets us add a state variable to your components
Closure
=>A closure is a feature in Javascript where an inner function hass access to the outer(enclosing) function's variable.
=> E.g
function outer(){
    var b=10;
    function inner(){
        var a=20;
        console.log(a+b);
    }
    return inner;
} 
Now if the inner function is called then the output will also be equale to 30 because of the use closure
Note:-Our components variable only update when the component is re rendered
=>React state only re-renders when the state variable finds some change
Note:- ... means spread
